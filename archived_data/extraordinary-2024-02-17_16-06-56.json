    "response": "Meaning:\nThe word 'extraordinary' describes something that is very unusual or remarkable. It signifies something that is out of the ordinary, not normal, or surpassing what is common or usual.\n\nSynonyms in different languages:\n- In Japanese, extraordinary can be translated as \"並外れた\" (Namihazureta) or \"素晴らしい\"(Subarashii).\n- Arabic: غير عادي (Ghair 'adi) or استثنائي (Istithnayi').\n- French: extraordinaire or exceptionnel\n- Chinese: 非凡 (Fēifán)  \n\nEtymology and deep roots:\nThe term 'extraordinary' is traced back to the late 15th century, and it comes from the Latin word 'extraordinarius' which means 'out of the common order'. This Latin term is a compound of the parts 'extra' and 'ordinarius'.\n\n- 'Extra' is a Latin word used as a preposition, adverb, or prefix meaning 'outside, beyond'. The origin of 'extra' traces back to the Proto-Indo-European root *eghs meaning 'out'.\n- The second part, 'ordinarius', derives from 'ordo' meaning 'row, rank, series, arrangement' and it implies a usual or regular order. This term further traces from the Proto-Indo-European root *ar- which signifies 'to fit together'.\n\nThereby, 'extraordinary' quite literally means \"out of the ordinary,\" signifying something unusual or remarkable.\n\nExamining the translations of 'extraordinary',\n\n- 'Namihazureta' in Japanese constitutes '並' meaning 'ordinary' and '外れた' meaning 'out-of'. This echoes the meaning of 'extraordinary' being out of the ordinary.\n- The Arabic 'غير عادي' (Ghair 'adi) translates to an deviation from the usual or common, echoing the essence of 'extraordinary'.\n- The French 'extraordinaire' has the same Latin roots as the English 'extraordinary', coming from Latin 'extraordinarius'.\n- '非凡' in Chinese, with '非' representing 'non' and '凡' meaning 'ordinary' also signifies the essence of 'extraordinary' being non-ordinary.\n\nThis takes us deep into the etymological labyrinth exposing our linguistic interconnectedness. The translation of the word extraordinary in these languages clearly illustrates their shared semantic field, reflecting its extraordinary universal appeal."
