    "prompt": "Conduct a comprehensive analysis of the word 'etymology', starting with its meaning, example_words, language, synonyms in Japanese, Arabic, French and Chinese, and provide an overview of its etymology. Dissect the word to identify any prefixes, roots, and suffixes it may contain. For the etymology of each identified part, provide meaning, example_words, the language of origin, a history and tracing and further etymology.\n\nDelve deeper by RECURSIVELY (to the extreme, try your best, at least 3) tracing the origins of these components to the extreme, ensuring to document the lineage of each part back to its absolute roots. Should any intermediate root have a multifaceted history, illuminate the various branches of its evolution.
